## Lumpsum-Project

Link to the live version of the app: https://share.streamlit.io/jh001db/lumpsum-project/main/SusPens_1.py

The LumpSum (or “Wet Bedrag Ineens”) is a new law which allows Dutch citizens to withdraw up to 10% of their pension when they reach their retirement age and spend it to their own preference (which is similar to the "Early access to Superannuation" in Australia). This could be used for paying off one's mortgage, invest in stocks or spend it on the education of one's (grand)children. However, some might spend it on a holiday, new (sports)car or other causes which are less sustainable. Hence, this dashboard visualizes how making use of this LumpSum affects one's pension plan. It could be used to help consumers make a rational choice concerning the “Wet Bedrag Ineens”.

Of course, there are many more factors influencing whether withdrawing (a portion of) the lumpsum would be either a sustainable choice or not. For example, a variety of allowances and premiums come into play when making the choice. Additionally, based on one's current income and remaining pension after withdrawing a LumpSum, it could be possible a surtex must be paid. Adding these variables would require more expertise concering pensions and tax law and would require a more complete dataset of the consumer, which is beyond the scope of this project.

This was my first project using StreamLit and it's my first time building something "real" using Python. If you have any feedback, I would be glad to receive your thoughts! I spend about 32 hours getting to know StreamLit and building this dashboard and learned a lot from it.
